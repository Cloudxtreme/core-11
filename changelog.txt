20171117
- class.clr.inc

- class.mag.inc
  -- typo in switchHealPet
- class.rog.inc
  -- typo in initial declare for DiscShadowHunter
- class.shm.inc
  -- clickDPS_SHM() -> sub click_DPS_SHM()	


20171116
- events.inc updated for death checks
- cast_rez()
  -- will remove touch of divine if it's there.
  -- adjusted the ECHOCHANNEL location so wont spam if not really casting spell or it gets inturrupted
- class.clr.inc
  -- dots added. priority will still be on healing
- class.shm.inc
  -- there was a check preventing single healing when there was less then 2 people hurt. the check is no more. the check was a lie.
- all classes
  -- combat loop exit check adjusted. priority set to automatic toons. should respond a little better.


20171112
- declare.inc undefined local variable (_verbage) in /heal switch. it has a purpose now
- class.clr.inc 
  -- leaving /heal xtarget would create a NULLPoint undefined variable. should be sorted now
- class.clr.inc / class.pal.inc
  -- /clr yaulp [##] - will set the % to use yaulp
  -- /clr yaulp - will enable/disable yaulp
  -- toon.ini->[buffs]->spellYaulp=[name of yaulp spell you wish to use]
  -- yaulp choice order: 
    -- spell is set in INI and memed.
    -- donals helm from SS hardcore if you have one.
    -- AA if you have it.
- class.wiz.inc
  -- changed buff validation routine. self runes now work.
  -- timing adjustments to force twincast routine.
  -- twincast condition available now. checks before either the AA or spell


20171111
- cast_condition()
  -- adjusted the logic to help speed it up a bit
- cast conditions now available for:
  -- GoM Nuke and GoM Nuke 2
- cast_dot() case typo caused an undefined variable.
  

20171109
- added in nuke/DoT pre-evaluations
  -- loosely based off RD macro EvaluatioCondition() function at Stockli's request
  -- toon.ini->[spells]->Nuke##Condition= (FALSE by DEFAULT)
  -- the INI setting is NOT parsed. proper variables are used e.g. ${Me.ID}
  -- the condition is paired with the nuke being cast
  -- setting the condition to FALSE will disable the check
  -- e.g. ${Target.Name.NotEqual[Fred]}  .. would evaluate the target as not being named Fred before nuking it
  -- e.g. ${Me.PctAggro} < 90  .. would make sure my agro is below 90% before nuking target
  -- you are looking to check that things are TRUE. if the evaluation is FALSE, the spell will not be cast
  -- keep mind core_cast() pre evaluates, mana/endurance costs, range, LOS, spell/item/disc/aa are ready, self stacking, elemental resist types, Gift of Manna procs, you're dead, and some other basic things   
  -- INI example: ranger
    -- Nuke1=Anticipated Shots
    -- Nuke1Condition=${Me.PctAggro} < 70 || (${Select[${Me.Class.ShortName},RNG]} && !${Me.DisplayName.Equal[FRED]})
    -- Nuke2=Focused Arrowrain
    -- Nuke2Condition=${Me.PctAggro} < 50
    -- Nuke3=Heartsplit
    -- Nuke3Condition=FALSE
- class.dru.inc
  -- fixed some typos. thanks toots
- class.ber.inc
  -- logic error. thanks again toots
- class.rng.inc
  -- added condition to summer spam nuke  
- class.ber.inc
  -- /ber [AE] enable/disable AE dps discs
  -- added AE AA War Cry of the Braxi
- fixed /pet heal switch. hopefully for the last time 
  

20171108
- clear_combat()
  -- should no longer clear target in manual mode when targeting a corpse of any kind
- can now force nuke cycles to stay in the loop till all nukes are done
  -- core.ini->[general]->ForceNukeLoop=TRUE to enable. FALSE (default)
  -- this will lock the nuke cycle untill all nukes in the INI are casted, then release for other class functions.

- class.clr.inc

- class.brd.inc
  -- bad /if-else flow for new restsong switch... still not tested this.


20171102
- logic change for tash/malo/cripple
  -- leaving the ini entrie class.ini->[spell]spellTash,malo,slow,cripple as FALSE but enabeling the /debuf mode for that skill will force the class to use the AA. otherwise put the spell in the INI
  -- THIS NEEDS A LOT OF TESTING!!!

  -- it used to be based off /core auto. i wanted it seperate. this way, even manual toons can be forced to react to raid event emotes.

  -- this is a non persistent setting. it will be cleared on Core start/restart
  -- easy hotkey for switching /bct clericname //clr rampage ${Target.DisplayName}
- Anti-resurrection list. add names to this for the fucktwats that will not take reses when you take the time to cast them.  or, conversly, people you just dont like
  -- core.ini->[no]->Rezlist=
  -- manual entries e.g. |bob|fred|mike and so on...
